\begin{document}

A vignette for the \cite{contextual} paper.

%% include your article here, just as usual
%% Note that you should use the \pkg{}, \proglang{} and \code{} commands.

\section{Introduction}
%% Note: If there is markup in \(sub)section, then it has to be escape as above.

In the canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler faces a number of slot machines, each with a potentially different payoff. It is the gamblers goal to make as much profit (or, in the case of gambling, as little loss) as possible by sequentially choosing which machine to play, learning from the observations as she goes along.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc4}

The goal of a data analysis is not only to answer a research question based on data but also to collect findings that support that answer. These findings usually take the form of a~table, plot or regression/classification model and are usually presented in articles or reports.
